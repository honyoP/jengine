# jEngine
pronounced '[dʒɛnʒɪn]'

## Why?
Because I simply can. I also wanted to create a roguelike, but didn't feel like
using an already existing engine or library. So I just hacked me own engine.

*I also wanted to flex on my friend a bit.*

## Should you use it?
You can, but only if you're willing to work with jank or fix it. Otherwise I would
recommend looking elsewhere.

## Is there any sensible documentation?
This one is a resounding no. I let Claude document some parts of it, but it's far
from being sensibly covered.
